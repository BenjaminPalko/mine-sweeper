# Meme Sweeper

This is a fun implementation of the classic 'mine sweeper' game, built using Django and React.

## Setup

Requirements are that you have [MISE-EN-PLACE](https://mise.jdx.dev/) installed. That's it.

1. `mise install` - Install tools
2. `mise t r client:install && mise t r server:install` - Install dependencies
3. `$(poetry --project=server env activate)` - Use python virtual env (execute this on every new terminal instance)
